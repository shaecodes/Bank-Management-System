# Bank Account Management System
This is a simple bank account management system implemented in Python. It provides basic functionalities such as creating accounts, depositing and withdrawing money, closing accounts, and viewing account records. The system also includes a basic authentication mechanism using a username and password to view account records.

# Features
- Create account: Users can create a new bank account by providing an account number and the account holder's name.
- Deposit: Users can deposit money into their bank account by specifying the account number and the amount to deposit.
- Withdraw: Users can withdraw money from their bank account by specifying the account number and the amount to withdraw.
- Close account: Users can close their bank account by providing the account number and confirming their choice.
- View accounts: Users can view the list of all existing bank accounts by providing the correct username and password for authentication.

# How to Run the Bank Account Management System
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the repository is cloned.
- Run the bank_management_system.py file using the Python interpreter.
- Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the bank account management system and perform various operations such as creating accounts, depositing and withdrawing money, closing accounts, and viewing account records.

# Dependencies
The Bank Account Management System requires Python 3.x to run. There are no additional external dependencies.

# Collaborating and Adding File Handling with CSV
I am open to collaborations and contributions to enhance the functionality of this bank account management system. One potential improvement could be adding file handling with CSV (Comma-Separated Values) to store account data persistently.  

CSV file handling can be added to store and retrieve account information in a structured format. This can provide benefits such as data persistence even when the program is closed, easy data backup and restore, and flexibility in handling large datasets.  

Here's how we can collaborate on this:  

- We can create a separate module for handling CSV file operations, such as reading from and writing to CSV files.
- We can modify the existing code to use the CSV module for storing and retrieving account data.
- We can add error handling to handle cases such as file not found, incorrect file format, and data integrity issues.
- We can discuss and decide on the structure of the CSV file, including the columns for storing account information such as account number, account holder's name, and balance.
- We can test the system thoroughly to ensure that the file handling functionalities are working correctly and do not introduce any bugs.
- If you're interested in collaborating and adding file handling with CSV to this bank account management system, please feel free to reach out. We can work together to enhance the system and make it more robust and efficient. Let's make this project even better!
